Features:
	â€¢	ðŸ’¾ Real-time ingestion from file-based sources
	â€¢	ðŸ”„ Stream-based transformations using PySpark
	â€¢	ðŸ•’ Timezone-aware processed_time for audit tracking
	â€¢	âœ… Output stored in fault-tolerant Delta format
	â€¢	ðŸ”§ Manual patching for malformed or missing data
	â€¢	ðŸ“„ Complete project documentation & setup guide included

ðŸ“‚ Includes:
	â€¢	Full project notebook
	â€¢	Sample input files
	â€¢	Complete PDF documentation
	â€¢	README for setup and usage
